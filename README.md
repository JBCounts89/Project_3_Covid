# United States COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker
The United States COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker is a web-based application that provides visualizations and insights into the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations across different states in the United States. This project aims to facilitate the understanding of vaccination rates and trends, allowing users to explore and analyze the data.

## Features
Data Extraction and Transformation: The project includes an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that retrieves vaccination data from a reliable source and prepares it for analysis.

Flask API Server: The project utilizes a Flask API server to serve the vaccination data to the frontend for visualization purposes.

Interactive Visualizations: The application leverages Plotly.js, a powerful JavaScript library, to generate interactive and dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore the data in an intuitive manner.

Insightful Analysis: The visualizations enable users to gain valuable insights into the vaccination progress, such as total vaccinations over time, daily vaccinations by state, and vaccination rates across states.

## Technologies Used
Python: Used for data processing, ETL pipeline, and backend development.
PostgreSQL: The vaccination data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval.
Flask: The Flask framework is employed to develop the API server that serves the vaccination data.
Plotly.js: This JavaScript library is utilized for generating interactive and visually appealing visualizations.
HTML/CSS: The frontend of the application is built using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.
