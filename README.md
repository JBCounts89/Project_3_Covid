# Project_3_Covid
    As mentioned in the Slack discussion due to the overall size of the dataset and ~10 minutes we have to present it I focused the analysis on the state of Utah during the year of 2021. 
    I also narrowed the questions of analysis to the following:
    How has the daily number of vaccinations changed across 2021?
    What is the average number of new vaccinations by month across Utah in 2021?
    How did the number of total vaccinations change across 2021 in Utah?
    How did the number of people vaccinated change across 2021 in Utah?
    How did the number of people fully vaccinated change across 2021 in Utah?
    
    I made graphs reflecting answers to all 5 of these questions and they're included in my Jupyter Notebook Project_3_mk1.ipynb. I also tried to write each cell as if you had no idea what I was doing and could replicate each step with the included guidance. Please let me know if you have questions or need me to change anything!
